AC24 is a community of people who participates in projects without a dedicated role. There is no clear border between the roles of our crews. Every code, commit and push are done proactively. This is how we work.

Visit [here](https://ac24.notion.site) to learn about us more.

## Looking for participation?

Sadly, there are no public projects are available for now.

If you are interested to contribute in our private repositories as one of our crew, you can find our recruiting page [here](https://ac24.notion.site/Recruiting-92e0a8964b4840b1a82b625712356374).
